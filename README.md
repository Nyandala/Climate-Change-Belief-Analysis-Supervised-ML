Using Natural language Processing (NLP) to classify the sentiment of tweet data


Sentiment analysis is the process of interpreting and classifying the feelings behind a body of text based on the usage of a series of words through the employment of text analysis techniques. Sentiment anaysis is helpful in determining the general public opinion towards a certain topic. Subsequently, businesses can utilise this information when designing their products and services and also moulding their marketing strategies. It can form a part of customer feedback. Additionally, these text analysis techniques can be used to extract insights from bodies of text as well.

With the change in time, consumers have become more conscience about acquiring products/services from brands that uphold certain values and ideals.They also consider the service provider's stances towards issues such as climate change. In order to appeal to these consumers, organisations should understand their sentiments.They need to understand how their products will be received whilst trying to decrease their environmental impact or carbon footprint. This can be achieved using Machine Learning.

Machine learning is a subset of Artifical Intelligence in which algorithms are applied to teach computers to make decisions, with little to no human intereference. Classification is a branch of Machine Learning where models are trained to pick up patterns in preexisting data then subsequently classify unseen data into appropriate classes. Classifiers will be used to categorise the tweets into four sentiment classes.
